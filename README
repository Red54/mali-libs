Mali userspace driver installation.
-----------------------------------

Installing the binaries:
------------------------

There are three types of binaries available: framebuffer, x11 and android.

There is no support for installing the android binaries, you will have to do so
manually.

For normal GNU/Linux systems you can use the 'framebuffer' or 'x11' targets, and
under ideal circumstances, they should do the right thing for you.

The makefiles present will try to determine which version of the userspace
binaries need to be installed. It will use the utility in version/ to query the
kernel driver for its version. The mali driver version can be overridden with
the VERSION= argument.

The makefiles present will also try to determine which of the 'armel' of 'armhf'
toolchains your system uses, so that the correct binaries can be installed. This
can be overridden with ABI= argument

When all the stars are aligned, the following should install the X11 binaries
matching your system:

> make x11

When things go wrong, or for some other reason the toolchain abi and the version
need to be forced, you can run the following to get the r3p0, hardfloat,
framebuffer binaries installed:

> make VERSION=r3p0 ABI=armhf framebuffer

Installing the EGL/GLES headers:
--------------------------------

These headers can be used to build EGL/GLES applications against.

To install them in /usr/include/, simply run:

> make headers

Verifying the EGL/GLES installation:
------------------------------------

Run the following to build the hello triangle utility:

> make test

When this succeeds, you can attempt to run it:

> test/test

If this shows a colourful triangle in a grey background measuring 480x480 then
all is fine!
